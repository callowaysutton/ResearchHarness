# Research Harness Library for Python

## Introduction

Welcome to the Research Harness Library for Python! This library provides a powerful framework for creating experiment harnesses in Python, making it easier to conduct and manage experiments in your research projects. Whether you're working on machine learning, data analysis, or any other scientific research, this library can help streamline your workflow.

## Features

- **Experiment Configuration**: Define experiments with customizable configurations to easily adjust parameters and settings.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Automatically log experiment details, metrics, and results for later analysis and reporting.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure reproducibility by saving experiment configurations, code versions, and random seeds.
- **Parallel Execution**: Run experiments in parallel to save time and resources.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Keep track of experiment progress, status, and dependencies.
- **Flexible Experiment Design**: Support for complex experiment setups, including hyperparameter tuning, grid search, and random search.

## Installation

You can install the Research Harness Library via pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/callowaysutton/ResearchHarness.git@main
```

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Python environment**:

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your experiments.

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install the Research Harness Library**:

   ```bash
   pip install research-harness
   ```

3. **Create an Experiment Script**:

   Create a Python script for your experiment using the Research Harness Library. Here's a simple example:

   ```python
   # my_experiment.py

   from research_harness import Experiment, ExperimentConfig

   def my_experiment(config: ExperimentConfig):
       # Your experiment code here
       print(f"Running experiment with config: {config}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       exp = Experiment()
       exp.run(my_experiment)
   ```

4. **Run Your Experiment**:

   Run your experiment script:

   ```bash
   python my_experiment.py
   ```

5. **Log and Monitor**:

The library will automatically log experiment details and results. You can customize the logging behavior to suit your needs.
